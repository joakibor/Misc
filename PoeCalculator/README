This is a calculator for the game Path of Exile.

This calculator will get the current prices off of an api from the website poe.ninja that tracks the value of different curreny items in the game.
After you have entered all your currency items it will convert the total value into the base currency value; chaos orbs. 
The calculator needs to be updated every 3 months as this is when the game "resets".

This was my first time working with both API's and GUI, so it might not be perfect, but it works.

The "app" let's you put in all your different currency, calculate the total value and then save to file for easy access later.
