This tool is still in its infancy stage.
At the moment all it does is grab a specified account's stats and rank from the Runescape highscores and saves it to file.

Eventually I want this to be able to track experience gain over time, display graphs and calculate how many ranks you've gone up/down over time.

There is a lot more functionality I'd like to add to this over time as well, but first things first.

More to come:
  * Give you a random skill to train, where what skill will be chosen has a different weight dependant on how much xp each skill has.
        (A skill with 15m xp is more likely to be chosen than a skill with 150m xp)
  * Calculate how much experience is left in each skill before maxing (maxing means every skill is level 99 or at 13.034m xp)
  * Eventually I want to also be able to plug into the item price API (I have heard very bad things about this)
      to be able to calculate total value of specified items.
  * ++
