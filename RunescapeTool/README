This tool is still in its infancy stage.
At the moment it grabs all the stats of an account from the jagex highscores through their api and saves it to file.

Eventually I want this to be able to track experience gain over time, display graphs and calculate how many ranks you've gone up/down over time.

There is a lot more functionality I'd like to add to this over time as well:
  * Give you a random skill to train, where what skill will be chosen has a different weighting dependant on how much xp each skill has.
        (A skill with 15m xp is more likely to be chosen than a skill with 150m xp)
  * Calculate how much experience is left in each skill before maxing (maxing means every skill is level 99 or at 13.034m xp)
  * Eventually I want to also be able to plug into the item price API to be able to calculate total value of specified items.
  * ++
